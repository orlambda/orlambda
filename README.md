Hi, I'm Orlando. I'm interested in <em>games</em> and <em>audio processing</em>. I'm working through <em>The Odin Project</em> and Stroustrup's <em>Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++</em>. My background is in music (classical piano and composition/production).

I also run the weekly [Portfolio Builders jams](https://itch.io/search?type=jams&q=portfolio+builders+jam) on itch.io, and will be uploading games and asset packs at [orlandoo.itch.io](https://orlandoo.itch.io/)
